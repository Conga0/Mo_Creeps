This content is intended to be saved for later, to be added all in one big content update.
I may still add small things over time as I think of them, but keep them in a list here so I can keep track
of what I have & haven't finished implementing into the mod when I get around to putting them all in

Remember the checklist!!








1.1.0 Changelog:
Added 3 new environmental hazards
Added 7 new creeps
Added new biome variation to the world, explore the same biomes in wildly different ways!
Birthday event now occurs during July, this is when the mod first started being worked on.
Pandora's Chest now has more permanent effects
Added a new welcoming message for new users to Mo Creeps
Added a new essence to the world...
Red sand is now considerably more palatable...

Master of None can not longer shoot poly orbs, It's all fun and games until you get Polymorphed
Fixed Tnt Minecart Riders being a bit too jittery in their cart
Fixed Worse Enemies Weak Shotgunners not working with minecarts properly

Fixed Devouring Ghosts eating magical liquids in the Void (modded biome)
Fixed Suur Stendari not having flame particles in Temple of the Art
Fixed Russian Translation not working on some status effects
Fixed Weak Hisii Shotgunners not jumping into minecarts
Fixed Hisii Shotgunners occasionally turning into their weaker versions in minecarts
Fixed Ceiling Fungus needing air to survive
Fixed some spells breaking in Spell Evolution compatibility mode. I don't know how much longer I'll keep proper translated support for the mod, especially since it's evolution's bug and not mine, but as long as it remains not too big a burden I'll maintain support.
Fixed a certain cat not eating the rat properly
Fixed Divine Being having much more health than intended in nightmare/purgatory
Fixed the Colossal Blob occasionally creating duplicate loot if baited offscreen
Fixed birthday rats spawning in the Powerplant at the wrong time
Fixed Random Weirdo Boss twitch voting event not working properly
Fixed Split Spell duplicating itself
Fixed Tesla Turret's shield not lining up with the visual effect
Fixed Devouring Ghost Minion's attracting projectiles
Fixed Colossal Blob boss not dropping loot
FIXED MAGIC DEVOURERS HAVING 90% DAMAGE REDUCTION FROM ALL SOURCES
Very slightly reduced blood produced by Angeling & Devilings
Red Sand now absorbs blood to grow
Reduced Sentry Damage in earlier parts of the game
Significantly reduced Sentry's range, he should now play a slightly different role than sniper by requiring a closer encounter but having better stats to cut through
Nerfed wand dropped by Pandora's Chest on normal difficulty
Mini Drones in earlier parts of the game are now more vulnerable to projectile damage
Slightly reduced Poring melee range
Significantly Reduced liquid produced by liquid bubbles in Purgatory & Nightmare. Previously they occasionally produced so much liquid it would forcefully clip through the floor and hurt you without warning
Reduced Poring damage in Coal Pits
Reduced Greater Cold Gazer's spawnrate in snowy depths
Slightly nerfed wand dropped by Toxic Worm Boss
Slightly Nerfed loot from Overzealous Polymage miniboss
Master of Mana are now considerably more tasty...
Significantly reduced blood bled by Master of Mana
Colossal & Creepy Blob are now immune to freezing, if you freeze melee them, it's possible for them to die before they spawn their babies, defeating the entire point behind the encounter, you're no longer challenged on your crowd-control ability
Added new Enlightened Alchemist variants 
Removed Cursed Orb Barrage. The spell felt unnecessary, it didn't introduce anything new and the method for unlocking it felt.. dumb, as if once you beat a Divine Being you had a 50% chance of getting a free run winner from a Cursed Chest.. Perhaps it could make a comeback later but for now it's removed until further notice.
Reduced Smoking Fungi's spawnrate in Fungal Caverns
Statues now spawn in the trophy room on the same run you achieve them
Slightly increased Wand Tinkering Crystal's hitbox
Buffed Weirdo's Shield
Removed Overzealous Polymage from the twitch vote spawn boss pool
Nerfed Coldgazer's loot pool
Pandora's Chest now scales based on the current biome, earlier areas shouldn't provide instantly god wands anymore and later areas should provide apt loot
Decreased range of Divine Being's Polymorph attack
Gave the Divine Being a retalitory shield when it takes damage
Optimised Duck Curse status effect
Halved amount of duck curse gained from eating duck mages
Minecart Hisii now conduct electricity
Optimised chaotic polymorph crystals & fixed it polymorphing weird things
Expanded the statue room to include trophys for new achievements
Greatly increased time between Psychic Bat's delusion attempts, it should now take 5 seconds between each attempt instead of 2, this should hopefully make them less frustrating enemies to fight against and make trying to avoid the attack feel more worth it instead of giving the feeling that you'll just be hit again anyways
Drastically reduced lifetime of Mass Status spells, this is not the actual effect duration but the projectile lifetime, previously if you gave a mass status spell a modifier like water trail for example, it would linger a very long time and create a lot of water
Added modded powders to Dissolve Powder's list
Reworked Masters of Immortality, they now no longer provide an unconcditional 20 seconds of Ambrosia, but rather cover their target with an Ambrosia stain, this should introduce the option of counterplay by using stain inflicting spells, such as Mass Wet, Water Trail or other means.
Modified Hideous Mass ragdolls to now include their limbs
Decreased spawnrate of Holy Orb Barrage, it should now be slightly rare overall, previously I felt like I could consistently find it every run down the main path and it felt excessively present for how good it is
Reduced Delusion's duration to 45 seconds, previously it felt too long but putting it down to 30 seconds felt like the effect would expire before it had a chance to trick you, hopefully 45 seconds will strike a balance between lasting long enough to trick you and being short enough to go away once the effect has done it's business.
Improved Divine Being's shield visuals
Increased maximum number of fairies visible at once, they used to have 20 available at any given time but this was broken at some point to only allow 5 at once, this has been fixed
Fixed Hisii Hobo having their sprite offset
Enraging Aura now affects your halo level

Fixed chaotic polymorph crystal not polymorphing innocent creatures
Fixed mudman's ragdoll using the wrong sprite sheet
Mudmen now have a slowing ranged attack
Improved Mudmen spawning
Removed audio components from magic mud
Fixed Glu Slug's projectile not being copyable by returners
Magic Mud no longer ignites itself
Magic Mud spawns in the magical potion pool very rarely now
Water and Soil no longer creates mud
Cold Gazer now has increased resistance against projectile damage, this should hopefully make his feel more durable than he currently is
Overzealous Polymage miniboss now has increased resistance against projectile damage for the same reasons as Cold Gazer
Minecart Riders can now very rarely have cool shades
Added a punishment for disobeying the 31st's MOTD
Reflective Weirdos now remember any damage boosts applied to the projectile they're hit by
Giga Bomb Hisii can now spawn very rarely outside of their pixelscene
Fixed Bubbles not spawning proper amounts of liquid in Nightmare/purgatory
Reduced Twitch Event Spells to Worms duration to 20 seconds
Added Mudmen Twitch Event
