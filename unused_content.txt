This content is intended to be saved for later, to be added all in one big content update.
I may still add small things over time as I think of them, but keep them in a list here so I can keep track
of what I have & haven't finished implementing into the mod when I get around to putting them all in

Remember the checklist!!



Suspended Lava Tank - mods/mo_creeps/files/entities/props/suspended_tank_lava.xml
Essence of Fungus - mods/mo_creeps/files/entities/items/pickups/essence_fungus.xml (functional but can't redeem it anywhere)

Portal Trap pixelscene - mods/mo_creeps/files/scripts/biomes/coalmines_populator.lua





1.1.0 Changelog:
Added 2 new environmental hazards
Added 1 new creep
Added new biome variation to the world, explore the same biomes in wildly different ways!
Birthday event now occurs during July, this is when the mod first started being worked on.
Pandora's Chest now has more permanent effects

Master of None can not longer shoot poly orbs, It's all fun and games until you get Polymorphed
Fixed Tnt Minecart Riders being a bit too jittery in their cart
