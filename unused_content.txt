This content is intended to be saved for later, to be added all in one big content update.

FIXED MAGIC DEVOURERS HAVING 90% DAMAGE REDUCTION FROM ALL SOURCES
Very slightly reduced blood produced by Angeling & Devilings
Red Sand now absorbs blood to grow
Reduced Sentry Damage in earlier parts of the game
Significantly reduced Sentry's range, he should now play a slightly different role than sniper by requiring a closer encounter but having better stats to cut through
Nerfed wand dropped by Pandora's Chest on normal difficulty
Mini Drones in earlier parts of the game are now more vulnerable to projectile damage
Slightly reduced Poring melee range
Significantly Reduced liquid produced by liquid bubbles in Purgatory & Nightmare. Previously they occasionally produced so much liquid it would forcefully clip through the floor and hurt you without warning
Reduced Poring damage in Coal Pits
Reduced Greater Cold Gazer's spawnrate in snowy depths
Slightly nerfed wand dropped by Toxic Worm Boss
Slightly Nerfed loot from Overzealous Polymage miniboss
Master of Mana are now considerably more tasty...
Significantly reduced blood bled by Master of Mana
Colossal & Creepy Blob are now immune to freezing, if you freeze melee them, it's possible for them to die before they spawn their babies, defeating the entire point behind the encounter, you're no longer challenged on your crowd-control ability
Added new Enlightened Alchemist variants 
Removed Cursed Orb Barrage. The spell felt unnecessary, it didn't introduce anything new and the method for unlocking it felt.. dumb, as if once you beat a Divine Being you had a 50% chance of getting a free run winner from a Cursed Chest.. Perhaps it could make a comeback later but for now it's removed until further notice.
Reduced Smoking Fungi's spawnrate in Fungal Caverns
Statues now spawn in the trophy room on the same run you achieve them
Slightly increased Wand Tinkering Crystal's hitbox
Buffed Weirdo's Shield
Removed Overzealous Polymage from the twitch vote spawn boss pool
Nerfed Coldgazer's loot pool
Pandora's Chest now scales based on the current biome, earlier areas shouldn't provide instantly god wands anymore and later areas should provide apt loot
Decreased range of Divine Being's Polymorph attack
Gave the Divine Being a retalitory shield when it takes damage
Optimised Duck Curse status effect
Halved amount of duck curse gained from eating duck mages
Minecart Hisii now conduct electricity
Optimised chaotic polymorph crystals & fixed it polymorphing weird things
Expanded the statue room to include trophys for new achievements
Greatly increased time between Psychic Bat's delusion attempts, it should now take 5 seconds between each attempt instead of 2, this should hopefully make them less frustrating enemies to fight against and make trying to avoid the attack feel more worth it instead of giving the feeling that you'll just be hit again anyways
Drastically reduced lifetime of Mass Status spells, this is not the actual effect duration but the projectile lifetime, previously if you gave a mass status spell a modifier like water trail for example, it would linger a very long time and create a lot of water
Added modded powders to Dissolve Powder's list
Reworked Masters of Immortality, they now no longer provide an unconcditional 20 seconds of Ambrosia, but rather cover their target with an Ambrosia stain, this should introduce the option of counterplay by using stain inflicting spells, such as Mass Wet, Water Trail or other means.
Modified Hideous Mass ragdolls to now include their limbs
Decreased spawnrate of Holy Orb Barrage, it should now be slightly rare overall, previously I felt like I could consistently find it every run down the main path and it felt excessively present for how good it is
Reduced Delusion's duration to 45 seconds, previously it felt too long but putting it down to 30 seconds felt like the effect would expire before it had a chance to trick you, hopefully 45 seconds will strike a balance between lasting long enough to trick you and being short enough to go away once the effect has done it's business.
Improved Divine Being's shield visuals
Increased maximum number of fairies visible at once, they used to have 20 available at any given time but this was broken at some point to only allow 5 at once, this has been fixed
Fixed Hisii Hobo having their sprite offset
Enraging Aura now affects your halo level
Cold Gazer now has increased resistance against projectile damage, this should hopefully make his feel more durable than he currently is
Overzealous Polymage miniboss now has increased resistance against projectile damage for the same reasons as Cold Gazer
Minecart Riders can now very rarely have cool shades
Added a punishment for disobeying the 31st's MOTD
Reduced Twitch Event Spells to Worms duration to 30 seconds
Added Mudmen Twitch Event
Various Modded & Vanilla bosses are now immune to Vulnerability, this is a direct nerf to Holy Orb Barrage but a much needed one, especially when it broke some bosses and made them immortal
Slightly decreased speed of Esoteric Fairies, they should now be easier to outrun if you're caught in a situation where you can't kill them but they've already spotted you
Improved visuals of Magical Fire Debuff
Added option to reduce particles spawned by some effects to help with performance
Giant Toxic Worms are no longer health buffed in the tower, I enjoyed the feeling of having giant super buffed worms chasing after you in the tower, it made my heart pump with excitement; but at the same time, at the risk of sounding egotistical, I know not everyone may have the same level of experience in Noita that I do to create god wands from junk and a trigger. I think this will ultimately be for the best balance wise for less experienced players. Worry not though diehards, this update should introduce a new boss to test your mettle.
Abandoned Orchestra's Meteor attack is now more consistent, it will always fire two meteors but they'll be 90 degrees of you, homing towards you simultaneously
Added Skoude Twitch Event by request
Removed something ominous from the Conjurer menu
Lowered chance to encounter secret potions in Pandora's Chest
Reduced frequency of Polymorph Crystal checks, they should now take 33% longer between each check to see if you're inside their radius. This should hopefully help with performance somewhat.
Magic Devourer no longer sucks in your mana while frozen
Added translation keys for Twitch Integration
Added slightly modified spawn list for alternate biomes Hisii Village
Added slightly modified spawn list for alternate biomes Worm Tunnels
Reduced mana cost of Bloody Bite from 100 to 50
Increased Divine Being's durability
Mass Materia Conversion now converts Blood to Red Sand
Added translation keys for some previously missing effects
Masters of Explosives can only apply one status effect per entity at a time now to save performance
Implemented Spoopy's Blob Ball attack to the Colossal Blob
Colossal Blob now has 50% damage resistance to all sources (applies to largest blob only)
Optimised Esoteric Being's audio
Added setting to enable Alternate Esoteric Being Sprite
Sharply reduced desert poring's damage output
Random Creeps & Weirdos Twitch Event now scales based off biome progress
New twitch event: Clowns, spawns a bunch of clowns to spit on the streamer
New Twitch Event: Swapper Curse, you gain the passive ability of a swapper mage
Names now appear above creature's heads in some twitch redeems
Removed some unnecessary tags from lua scripts
Optimised split shot (I think) (Thankyou Copi)
Some settings which can update immediately during gamepaly now update immediately
Added mod support for alternate biomes lukki boss health scaling
Added Swampling to the Esoteric Fairy delusion list
New perk: Revenge Reflection, it spawns in the default perk pool and lets you create a copy of a projectile you're hit by, boost it's damage, and fire it back at your attacker
Divine Being now has 5 frames of invincibility after taking damage, goal is to counteract musical note abuse
Slightly increased delay between Esoteric Fairy's attacks
Removed Stevari from the Pandora's Chest enemy pool
Increased animation speed of Angeling & Deviling's wings (0.2s wait time to 0.13s)
Adjusted Toxic Worm Nest's ceiling to look more cave-like and natural
Slightly Reduced the health of Glu Slugs, they should die faster now, especially if you start with bouncing burst
Divine Being is now immune to slice damage (homing omega sawblade & forget builds for easy kills felt underwhelming)
Divine Liquid lasts for a shorter amount of time when drunk
Disabled most Twitch Events if CTEP is enabled
Locust Swarm's now produce 50% more insect husk
Significantly increased amount of Red Sand appearing in the pyramid
Significantly increased Locust Swarm spawnrate in the desert
3am Toxic Worm nest event now occurs on the 1st of the month as well
Upgraded Overzealous Polymaster to have a double attack, the idea behind this is to break through permanent shield, previously a shield would nullify this enemy entirely
Reworked Desert locust spawns to be rarer above ground but much more frequent underground
Slightly reduced desert poring spawnrate
Halloween & Smissmass seasonal events now occur starting on the 15th instead of the 22nd
Greater Coldgazer miniboss is now vulnerable to touch magic

Fixed typo in mana degradation, "loosing" to "losing"
Added a check to the welcome message for already playing users
Revenge Reflection no longer copies teleport bolts
Increased frequency of projectiles being turned into ducks
Sacrificing Pandora's Chest to the mountain altar now displays more ominous text
